## üîß Tech Stack

* **Frontend Framework:** Next.js (using JSX)
* **Icons:** `react-icons`
* **Animation:** GSAP & Framer Motion (3D-ready)

## üß≠ Site Architecture & Pages

### 1. **Home**

* **Hero Section:** 3D or animated tech-themed banner (Framer Motion + GSAP)

## üé® Design Direction

* **Color Palette:** 2 primary + 1 accent (cool tones like deep blue + violet + white/grey)
* **Fonts:** Sans-serif (e.g., Inter, DM Sans)
* **Spacing:** Wide padding, clear white space
* **Animations:** Subtle entrance + hover animations (no overload)

---

## üîÑ Navigation Flow

1. Sticky **navbar** with smooth scroll and active link highlighting
2. Scroll-based effects using GSAP (home, about, services)
3. Route-based animation between pages using Framer Motion

---

## üì¶ Suggested Folder Structure

```
/components
  Navbar.jsx
  Footer.jsx
  Hero.jsx
  ...
/pages
  index.jsx
  about.jsx
  services.jsx
  contact.jsx
  blogs/
    index.jsx
    [slug].jsx
/public
  /images
  /icons
/styles
  globals.css (or Tailwind setup)
```

---

## ‚úÖ Next Steps

1. **Set up the Next.js project** with Tailwind, Framer Motion, GSAP, and react-icons.
2. Build the layout (Navbar + Footer) with routing.
3. Develop each page component-wise using above structure.
4. Add animations gradually (GSAP scroll, Framer transitions).
5. Final polish with responsiveness & accessibility.

Would you like me to generate the initial folder structure and scaffold files, or begin with the layout (Navbar + Footer)?

CREATE LOGO: PROMPT:
Prompt:
"Design a modern, innovative logo for an IT and software company. The logo should reflect technology,
 creativity, and cutting-edge innovation. Incorporate elements such as circuits, code, abstract digital
  shapes, or minimalist tech icons. Use a sleek, professional color scheme (e.g., blue, black,
   silver, or gradient tech tones). The design should be clean, scalable, and suitable for web,
    app, and print. Avoid overly complex details‚Äîfocus on a 
futuristic yet professional aesthetic that represents growth, intelligence, and digital solutions."
